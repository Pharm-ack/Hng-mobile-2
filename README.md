## Theming

The app supports light and dark themes, which can be toggled by the user. The theme system is implemented using React Context and includes:

- **Light Theme**: Bright background with dark text.
- **Dark Theme**: Dark background with light text.

### Theme Colors

```ts
export const lightTheme = {
  background: "#FFFFFF",
  text: "#000000",
  cardBackground: "#F5F5F5",
  skeletonBackground: "#E1E1E1",
  primary: "#FF6B00",
};

export const darkTheme = {
  background: "#121212",
  text: "#FFFFFF",
  cardBackground: "#1E1E1E",
  skeletonBackground: "#2A2A2A",
  primary: "#FF6B00",
};
```

---

## Custom Fonts

The app uses the **Axiforma** font family, which is applied globally using a custom `CustomText` component. The font weights supported are:

- **Axiforma-Regular**
- **Axiforma-Bold**
- **Axiforma-Black**

---

## Dynamic Splash Screen

The splash screen dynamically adapts to the user's theme preference:

- **Light Theme**: White background.
- **Dark Theme**: Black background.

This is achieved using the `expo-splash-screen` library and runtime theme detection.

---

## API Integration

The app fetches country data from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/). Key endpoints used:

- **All Countries**: `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`
- **Country Details**: `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{name}?fullText=true`

---

## Future Improvements

- **Offline Support**: Cache API responses for offline access.
- **Favorites**: Allow users to save favorite countries.
- **Animations**: Add smooth transitions and animations.
- **Localization**: Support multiple languages.
- **Advanced Filters**: Add more filter options (population range, currency, etc.).
